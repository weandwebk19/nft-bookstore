  "descStory": "The NFT Bookstore is a project that started in 2022 and will be completed in 2023 by a group of friends who are about to graduate. Mrs. Tuyen was the one who came up with this idea and they signed up to try their hand at this new project. They researched and built it a month before the Lunar New Year. Hopefully it will be completed and appreciated by July 2023. This was probably the last project they did in university.",
  "titleMission": "Our mission",
  "descMission": "The NFT market is currently booming, and this is only the beginning. There is a very lengthy history of books. The book trade was crucial to preserving information and making it available to people even in ancient times. But at that time, books were not written on paper but rather on papyrus rolls, palm leaves, or burned clay tablets. One of the main pillars of our cultural identity is the book. We at NFT Bookstore are confident that the book will continue to play its essential part in the history of humanity even if it is at a turning point in the current electronic era. That's why we've developed NFT Books, a platform that introduces the next major development in publishing.",
